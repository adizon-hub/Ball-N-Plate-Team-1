# Ball-N-Plate-Team-1

# 1- INTRODUCTION

  For this project we used a controller to help balance a ball on a plate system that must be designed using Matlab, Simulink and Coppelia. The overall goal of this system is keep   a ball balanced at the center of the plate and must be able to react accordingly to the ballâ€™s position to avoid the ball rolling off the plate.
